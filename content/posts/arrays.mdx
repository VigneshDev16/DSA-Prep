## Types of Arrays:
   * -> 1-D Array
   * -> 2-D Array
   * -> Multi-dimensional Array
   * -> Jaggard Array (Contains different sizes of sub-arrays)

## Properties of Arrays
    * Arrays contains elements of same datatype
    * Arrays are of fixed size
    * Arrays has sequential memory allocation
    * Array index always starts from zero

## Applications of Arrays
    #### Whenever there is an usecase having multiple data, array can be used, for example
    * Stack
    * Queue
    * Sorting
    * Task management


## Let me give an example of Integer Array

```
    int a = [1,2,3,4,5]
```
This array consists of five integer elements

## How to access an element of the array
You can access the element by using the index value.
```
    int a = [1,2,3,4,5]
    console.log(a[3])

    output : 4
```
Since the index of an array starts from 0 , the first element can be access as ``` a[0] ```, second element as ``` a[1] ``` and goes on.<br/>
Accessing the element of an array is very easy and it takes time complexity of O(n).
